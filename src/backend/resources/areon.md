# Intro to Blockchain
What is a coin?
A crypto coin is a digital asset that operates on its own blockchain. Think of a blockchain as a digital ledger that records all transactions. The entries in that ledger are about transactions that occur on the blockchain. The coin is your currency in the chain.

Coins like AREA have their own unique blockchains and serve as both the asset you can own and the network on which transactions occur. In simple terms, when you own a crypto coin, you own a piece of the network where it operates.

What is a token?
A token is also a digital asset, but it doesn't have its own blockchain. Instead, it operates on another coin's blockchain. For example, many tokens run on the Ethereum blockchain or Binance Smart Chain.

Tokens follow certain standards, like ARC-20, that allow them to interact seamlessly with other tokens and applications on that network. Tokens can represent a sub-currency. But they are often used to represent assets like real estate or art, or to access features in a software.

Some blockchain projects such as Areon Network can start their journey as a token, and later build their community, while they are developing their own chain.

What is a dApp?
dApp is short for Decentralized Application. It is a software that runs on a blockchain rather than on a centralized server. Unlike traditional apps where a single company controls the data and functionality, dApps are open-source and operate on a peer-to-peer network.

This means that no single entity has control over the application, making it more transparent and resistant to censorship or limitations.

What is a Smart Contract?
A Smart Contract is a self-executing code. It is a digital contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts run on a blockchain, ensuring that it is tamper-proof and transparent.

Since retrospective editing or tampering is not possible in blockchain, the contracts are secure and permanent.

Once conditions specified in the contract are met, it automatically executes actions like transferring tokens or coins. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, making transactions more efficient and secure.

What are NFT protocols?
NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. NFT protocols refer to the rules or standards that govern how these unique digital assets function on a blockchain.

Unlike coins or tokens, which are interchangeable with each other, NFTs are unique. They can represent ownership of specific items like digital art, collectibles, or even real estate.

Popular NFT protocols include ARC-721 and ARC-1155 on the Areon blockchain, which define how to create, transfer, and interact with NFTs.

What is Areon?
Areon Network is a unique, decentralized layer 1 blockchain project with a spotless track record of stable development since day 1.

Areon Network is developing Areon Chain, where anyone can build new dApps, perform daily interactions of sending and receiving payments instantly for incredibly low fees.

Our consensus mechanism is called Proof of Area. It is a unique technology, which supports up to 600,000 TPS without issues, and completes a transaction in around 100 milliseconds.

What can you do on Areon?
Areon Network is a decentralized ecosystem. The sole purpose of our project is to give everyone a convenient platform with daily, practical uses.

We want Areon to be the network that you prefer for all your payment transaction needs, your space for app development and your favorite spot for entertainment.

You can use Areon Chain to send and receive payments with unprecedented speed and competitive gas fees.

You can also mint NFTs on our chain and hold them in your Areon Wallet securely.

As we build our NFT marketplace MetAreon on our chain, you will also be able to buy, sell or swap NFTs along with many other unique features for relatively cheaper gas fees.

Due to our chain’s powerful structure and scalability, developers from around the world will start using Areon Chain as their basis for dApp development with low costs. As a result, you will find various apps that work on Areon including fun games.

Moreover, you can interact with Areon City which is the key element for the validation process in our chain with the Proof of Area consensus mechanism.

The land ownership in our city is the essential first step for becoming a validator for the chain.

What is Areon Chain?
It is our layer 1 blockchain, that offers cost-effective and stable results for crypto transactions.

Areon Chain is powered by our unique technology Proof of Area. It is set to redefine transaction speeds with unparalleled processing capability in the blockchain industry.

Blockchain technology has scalability challenges, particularly in processing large volumes of transactions. Areon chain aims to overcome this hurdle by providing superior technology.

Speed is a critical factor in the success of any blockchain network. There are many other layer 1 chains that can reach high speeds, but they end up with unstable results. We conducted extensive research and development to optimize transaction times with more efficient coding.

As a result, Areon Chain is now capable of near-instant confirmations. Areon chain sets a new benchmark for speed by leveraging the power of its Proof of Area-based consensus algorithm.

Areon Chain's advanced architecture and optimized algorithm enable us to achieve transaction speeds that were previously unimaginable. With the ability to handle an astonishing number of 600,000 transactions per second, Areon chain paves the way for real-time, high throughput blockchain applications, catering to the demands of modern decentralized economies.

Furthermore, traditional blockchain solutions often struggle with scalability as network usage grows. We designed Areon Chain to be capable of scaling upwards in response to growing demand, without compromising performance.

The combination of the PoA consensus algorithm and advanced network optimization techniques allow us to handle massive transaction volumes with remarkable efficiency.

The unprecedented transaction speed of Areon Chain has far-reaching implications for the broader blockchain ecosystem. High-performance blockchain applications such as financial systems, supply chain management, and decentralized exchanges can thrive on the Areon Chain, opening up new possibilities for businesses and users worldwide.

Our development team is dedicated to ongoing research, optimizing network performance, and exploring new techniques to deliver even faster transaction processing capabilities.

In many ways, Areon Chain emerges as a game-changer in the blockchain industry. We present a significant milestone in blockchain evolution, laying the foundation for a new era of high-performance, decentralized applications for everyone.

What is Proof of Area?
Proof of AREA algorithm is a new consensus mechanism technology based on the cost reduction of Proof of Stake. The ideas are very similar, but with an important twist.

In Areon Network, establishing consensus for the network transactions is given to the users with the validator role. The validators will play this necessary role in exchange for network transaction rewards

The first step for becoming a validator is obtaining land in Areon City. Initially, the cost will be 10,000 AREA for the purchase. There will be other criteria for qualification. We will disclose this information shortly before the launch of our mainnet.

Thus, owning a land in Areon City is the first step of becoming a validator. This ownership entitles you to certain other benefits. You can use that digital space to build an app or to advertise on it. You can lend it or sell it to someone else at any point.

As such, the Proof of Area mechanism brings several beneficial reasons for long-term holders, which helps us shield our investors against selling pressure.

All transactions made in Areon ecosystem will be verified on the Proof of Area algorithm

# Introduction 
Overview of the Areon Chain and the AREA token.

On January 11 at 16:53 UTC, 2024, the AreonChain Testnet was deployed and the first block of the AreonChain was created by the AreonChain validators. The AreonChain is a proof-of-Area blockchain network built using the Tendermint and leveraging CometBFT for consensus. The Areon community, through Areon governance, voted (Snapshot and on-chain) in favor of adopting Areon as the Layer 1 token of the AreonChain for staking to validators in order to secure the chain and for stakers of the L1 token to govern the network. The utility of the AreonChain’s coin, AREA , is apparent in three areas: Staking, Security and Governance.

Staking: AREA holders have the option to serve as validators (and self-delegate) or to delegate their stake to existing validators. Such delegation increases the likelihood of the chosen validators entering or staying in the active validator set, thereby becoming a participant in the network’s consensus process.
Security: Staking AREA directly contributes to AreonChain security. As more AREA holders choose to stake their tokens across a diverse range of validators in the network and the total amount of stake on the network increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for a coordinated attack to influence a consensus decision.
Governance: AREA empowers AREA holders to propose and vote on proposals, directly influencing the evolution of the AreonChain through a democratic process. The subject matter of proposals can vary from changing a governable parameter on the AreonChain, spending AREA community funds, and updating the software that AreonChain nodes are running, among other things.

# Concepts
## Accounts
Crypto Wallets (or Accounts) can be created and represented in unique ways on different blockchains. For developers who interface with account types on Areon, e.g. during wallet integration on their dApp frontend, it is therefore important to understand that accounts on Areon are implemented to be compatible with EVM addresses.

Creating Accounts
To create one account you can either create a private key, a keystore file (a private key protected by a password), or a mnemonic phrase (a string of words that can access multiple private keys).

Aside from having different security features, the biggest difference between each of these is that a private key or keystore file only creates one account. Creating a mnemonic phrase gives you control of many accounts, all accessible with that same phrase.

Blockchains like Areon, support creating accounts with mnemonic phrases, otherwise known as hierarchical deterministic key generation (HD keys). This allows the user to create accounts on multiple blockchains without having to manage multiple secrets.

HD keys generate addresses by taking the mnemonic phrase and combining it with a piece of information called a derivation path. Blockchains can differ in which derivation path they support. To access all accounts from an mnemonic phrase on a blockchain, it is therefore important to use that blockchain's specific derivation path.

Representing Accounts
The terms "account" and "address" are often used interchangeably to describe crypto wallets. In Areon, an account designates a pair of public key (PubKey) and private key (PrivKey). The derivation path defines what the private key, public key, and address would be.

The PrivKey is used to generate digital signatures to prove that an address associated with the PrivKey approved of a given message. The proof is performed by applying a cryptographic scheme to the PrivKey, known as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), to generate a PubKey that is compared with the address in the message.

Areon Addresses
Areon defines its own custom Account type to implement a HD wallet that is compatible with Ethereum type addresses. It uses Ethereum's ECDSA secp256k1 curve for keys (eth_secp265k1) and satisfies the EIP84 for full BIP44 paths. This cryptographic curve is not to be confused with Bitcoin's ECDSA secp256k1 curve.

The root HD path for Areon-based accounts is m/44'/60'/0'/0. Areon uses the Coin type 60 to support Ethereum type accounts.

The custom Areon EthAccount satisfies the AccountI interface from the Areon auth module and includes additional fields that are required for Ethereum type addresses:

Addresses and Public Keys
BIP-0173 defines a new format for segregated witness output addresses that contains a human-readable part that identifies the Bech32 usage. Areon uses the following HRP (human readable prefix) as the base HRP:

Network	Mainnet	Testnet
Areon	areon	areon
There are 3 main types of HRP for the addresses available by default on Areon:

Addresses and Keys for accounts, which identify users (e.g. the sender of a message). They are derived using the eth_secp256k1 curve.
Addresses and Keys for validator operators, which the operators of validators. They are derived using the eth_secp256k1 curve.
Addresses and Keys for consensus nodes, which identify the validator nodes participating in consensus. They are derived using the ed25519 curve.
Address bech32 Prefix	Pubkey bech32 Prefix	Curve	Address Byte Length	Pubkey Byte Length
Accounts	areon	areonpub	eth_secp256k1	20	33 (compressed)
Validator	areonvaloper	areonvaloperpub	eth_secp256k1	20	33 (compressed)
Consensus Nodes	areonvalcons	areonvalconspub	ad25519	20	32
Address Formats for Clients
EthAccount can be represented in both Bech32 (areon...) and hex (0x...) formats for Ethereum's Web3 tooling compatibility.

The Bech32 format is the default format for SDK queries and transactions through CLI and REST clients. The hex format on the other hand, is the Ethereum common.Address representation.

Address (Bech32): areon1fl48vsnmsdzcv85q5d2q4z5ajdha8yu3q00s36
Address (EIP55HEX): 0x4feA76427B8345861e80A3540a8a9D936FD39391

## Chain ID
A chain ID is a unique identifier that represents a blockchain network. We use it to distinguish different blockchain networks from each other and to ensure that transactions and messages are sent to the correct network. areon network follows the format of identifier_EIP155-version format.

Official Chain IDs
The latest Chain ID (i.e highest Version Number) is the latest version of the software.

Testnet

Name	Chain ID	Identifier	EIP155 Number	Version Number	Active
Areon Mainnet	areon_463-1	areon	463	1	Yes
Areon Testnet	areon_462-1	areon	462	1	Yes
The Chain Identifier
Every chain must have a unique identifier or chain-id. Tendermint requires each application to define its own chain-id in the genesis.json fields. However, in order to comply with EIP155 standard for chain upgrades, areon-compatible chains must implement a special structure for their chain identifiers.

You can also lookup the EIP155 CHAIN_ID by referring to chainlist.org

Structure
Areon Chain ID contains 3 main components

Identifier: Unstructured string that defines the name of the application
EIP155 Number: Immutable EIP155 CHAIN_ID that defines the replay attack protection number.
Version Number: Is the version number (always positive) that the chain is currently running. This number MUST be incremented every time the chain is upgraded or forked in order to avoid network or consensus errors.
Format
The format for specifying and areon compatible chain-id in genesis is the following:

{identifier}_{EIP155}-{version}

## Gas & Fees
Users need to pay a fee to submit transactions on the Areon. And it is important to understand how the Areon implements an Ethereum-type fee calculation.

Therefore this overview explains the basics of gas calculation, how to provide fees for transactions and how the Ethereum-type fee calculation uses a fee market (EIP1559) for prioritizing transactions.

Basics
Why do transactions need fees?
If anyone can submit transactions to a network at no cost, the network can be overrun by a handful of actors sending large numbers of fraudulent transactions to clog up the network and stop it from working.

The solution to this is a concept called “gas," which is a resource consumed throughout transaction execution. In practice, a small amount of gas is spent on each step of code execution, thus effectively charging for use of a validator’s resources and preventing malicious actors from halting a network at will.

What is gas?
In general, gas is a unit that measures the computational intensity of a particular transaction — in other words, how much work would be required to evaluate and perform the job. Complex, multi-step transactions, such as a Areon transaction that delegates to a dozen validators, require more gas than simple, single-step transactions, such as a Areon transaction to send tokens to another address.

When referring to a transaction, “gas” refers to the total quantity of gas required for the transaction. For example, a transaction may require 300,000 units of gas to be executed.

Gas can be thought of as electricity (kWh) within a house or factory, or fuel for automobiles. The idea is that it costs something to get somewhere.

How is gas calculated?
In general, there’s no way to know exactly how much gas a transaction will cost without simply running it. Otherwise, there are ways to estimate the amount of gas a transaction will require, based on the details of the transaction fields, and data. In the case of the EVM, for example, each bytecode operation has a corresponding amount of gas.

How does gas relate to fees?
While gas refers to the computational work required for execution, fees refer to the amount you actually spend to execute the transaction. They are derived using the following formula:

Total Fee = Gas x Gas Price (the price per unit of gas)

If “gas” was measured in kWh, the “gas price” would be the rate (in dollars per kWh) determined by your energy provider, and the “fees” would be your bill. Just as with electricity, gas price is liable to fluctuate over a given day, depending on network traffic.

How are Fees Handled on Areon?
Fees on Ethereum include multiple implementations that were introduced over time.

Originally, a user would specify a GasPrice and GasLimit within a transaction—much like a Areon transaction. A block proposer would receive the entire gas fee from each transaction in the block, and they would select transactions to include accordingly.

With proposal EIP-1559 and the London Hard fork, gas calculation changed. The GasPrice from above has now been split into two separate components: a BaseFee and PriorityFee. The BaseFee is calculated automatically based on the block size and is burned once the block is mined. The PriorityFee goes to the proposer and represents a tip, or an incentive for a proposer to include the transaction in a block.

Gas Price = Base Fee + Priority Fee

## AreonCLI Arguments
AreonCLI is an all-in-one command-line interface (CLI). It enables users to run an Areon Chain node, manage wallets, and interact with the network through queries and transactions.

The CLI allows users to input commands to perform various operations and communicate with the network. With the features provided by AreonCLI, it becomes easier to perform different tasks on the Areon and manage the network effectively.

Example commands
Command	Description
-h / -help	Help for CLI
version	Print the application binary version information
keys list	Imported or created wallets
keys add [name]	Create a new wallet
keys unsafe-export-eth-key	Exporting your Areon wallet as evm
start	Run the full node
debug addr [address]	Convert an address between hex encoding and bech32
init [moniker]	Initialize private validator, p2p, genesis, and application configuration files
config [key]	Create or query an application CLI configuration file

tendermint reset-state	Remove all the data and WAL
tendermint show-validator	Show this node's tendermint validator info
tendermint show-node-id	Show this node's ID

## Encoding
Encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format to another to make it more secure and efficient. In the context of blockchain, encoding is used to ensure that data is stored and transmitted in a way that is secure and easily accessible.

The Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) is a serialization format used extensively in Ethereum's execution clients. Its purpose is to encode arbitrarily nested arrays of binary data, and it is the main encoding method used to serialize objects in Ethereum. RLP only encodes structure and leaves encoding specific atomic data types, such as strings, integers, and floats, to higher-order protocols.

In Ethereum, integers must be represented in big-endian binary form with no leading zeroes, making the integer value zero equivalent to the empty byte array. The RLP encoding function takes in an item, which is defined as a single byte whose value is in the [0x00, 0x7f] range or a string of 0-55 bytes long. If the string is more than 55 bytes long, the RLP encoding consists of a single byte with value 0xb7 (dec. 183) plus the length in bytes of the length of the string in binary form, followed by the length of the string, followed by the string. RLP is used for hash verification, where a transaction is signed by signing the RLP hash of the transaction data, and blocks are identified by the RLP hash of their header. RLP is also used for encoding data over the wire and for some cases where there should be support for efficient encoding of the merkle tree data structure. The Ethereum execution layer uses RLP as the primary encoding method to serialize objects, but the newer Simple Serialize (SSZ) replaces RLP as the encoding for the new consensus layer in Ethereum 2.0.

Encoding Formats
Protocol Buffers
The Cosmos Stargate release introduces protobuf as the main encoding format for both client and state serialization. All the EVM module types that are used for state and clients (transaction messages, genesis, query services, etc) will be implemented as protocol buffer messages.

Amino
The Cosmos SDK also supports the legacy Amino encoding format for backwards compatibility with previous versions, specially for client encoding and signing with Ledger devices. Areon does not support Amino in the EVM module, but it is supported for all other Cosmos SDK modules that enable it.

RLP
Recursive Length Prefix (RLP), is an encoding/decoding algorithm that serializes a message and allows for quick reconstruction of encoded data. Areon uses RLP to encode/decode Ethereum messages for JSON-RPC handling to conform messages to the proper Ethereum format. This allows messages to be encoded and decoded in the exact format as Ethereum's.

## Pending state
When a transaction is submitted to the Ethereum network, it first goes into the pending status, waiting to be executed by the nodes. A transaction can be in the pending state for a longer duration if the gas price is set very low in the transaction and the nodes are busy processing other higher gas price transactions.

During the pending state, the transaction initiator is allowed to change the transaction fields at any time. They can do so by sending another transaction with the same nonce.

Areon vs. Ethereum
In Ethereum, pending blocks are generated as they are queued for production by miners. These pending blocks include pending transactions that are picked out by miners, based on the highest reward paid in gas. This mechanism exists as block finality is not possible on the Ethereum network. Blocks are committed with probabilistic finality, which means that transactions and blocks become less likely to become reverted as more time (and blocks) passes.

Areon is designed quite differently on this front as there is no concept of a "pending state". Areon uses Tendermint Core BFT consensus which provides instant finality for transaction. For this reason, Areon does not require a pending state mechanism, as all (if not most) of the transactions will be committed to the next block.

Another significant difference with Ethereum, is that blocks are produced by validators or block producers, who include transactions from their local mempool into blocks in a first-in-first-out fashion. Transactions on areon cannot be ordered or cherry picked out from the Tendermint node mempool.

Pending State Queries
Areon will make queries which will account for any unconfirmed transactions present in a node's transaction mempool. A pending state query made will be subjective and the query will be made on the target node's mempool. Thus, the pending state will not be the same for the same query to two different nodes.

## Signing
Signing is the process of creating a digital signature using a private key to verify a transaction on the Areon network. The signature is created using a specific cryptographic algorithm that ensures the authenticity and integrity of the transaction using methods like wallets and the CLI.

There are different methods for signing, but one of the most commonly used methods is the EIP-712 standard. Areon leverages EIP-712 to homogenize the interaction between the EVM and Areon.

EIP-712
EIP-712 introduces a standard for signing "typed-data" in a human-readable format. This standard allowed users to understand the data they are signing more easily and provides a more secure way to sign data, as it is less susceptible to phishing attacks. EIP-712 is not an Ethereum transaction type, but a method for signing structured data that can be used for authentication and indirect influence on program logic.

To support signing transactions, Areon utilizes the EIP-712 protocol for encoding Areon transactions in a format that can be understood and processed by Ethereum signers. This approach helps to overcome the limitations of Ethereum signing devices, which often do not support signing arbitrary bytes for security reasons.

The process works as follows:

A Areon transaction is represented as a JSON sign-doc.
The JSON sign-doc is converted to an EIP-712 object, which consists of types and messages.
The EIP-712 object is signed using the Ethereum signer using a wallet.
The same process is performed on the node to verify the signature.
This compatibility makes it easier for users to interact with both Ethereum and Areon, ultimately fostering greater interoperability between the two ecosystems.

## Transactions
A transaction refers to an action initiated by an account which changes the state of the blockchain. To effectively perform the state change, every transaction is broadcasted to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the blockchain state machine; after this happens, a validator will validate, execute the transaction and propagate the resulting state change to the rest of the network.

To process every transaction, computation resources on the network are consumed. Thus, the concept of "gas" arises as a reference to the computation required to process the transaction by a validator. Users have to pay a fee for this computation, all transactions require an associated fee. This fee is calculated based on the gas required to execute the transaction and the gas price.

Additionally, a transaction needs to be signed using the sender's private key. This proves that the transaction could only have come from the sender and was not sent fraudulently.

In a nutshell, the transaction lifecycle once a signed transaction is submitted to the network is the following:

A transaction hash is cryptographically generated.
The transaction is broadcasted to the network and added to a transaction pool consisting of all other pending network transactions.
A validator must pick your transaction and include it in a block in order to verify the transaction and consider it "successful".
The transaction hash is a unique identifier and can be used to check transaction information, for example, the events emitted, if was successful or not.

Transactions can fail for various reasons. For example, the provided gas or fees may be insufficient. Also, the transaction validation may fail. Each transaction has specific conditions that must fullfil to be considered valid. A widespread validation is that the sender is the transaction signer. In such a case, if you send a transaction where the sender address is different than the signer's address, the transation will fail, even if the fees are sufficient.

Transaction Types
Ethereum transactions refer to actions initiated by EOAs (externally-owned accounts, managed by humans), rather than internal smart contract calls. Ethereum transactions transform the state of the EVM and therefore must be broadcasted to the entire network.

Ethereum transactions also require a fee, known as gas. (EIP-1559) introduced the idea of a base fee, along with a priority fee which serves as an incentive for miners to include specific transactions in blocks.

There are several categories of Ethereum transactions:

regular transactions: transactions from one account to another
contract deployment transactions: transactions without a to address, where the contract code is sent in the data field
execution of a contract: transactions that interact with a deployed smart contract, where the to address is the smart contract address
An Ethereum transaction includes the following information:

recipient : receiving address
signature : sender's signature
nonce : counter of tx number from account
value : amount of ETH to transfer (in wei)
data : includes arbitrary data. Used when deploying a smart contract or making a smart contract method call
gasLimit : max amount of gas to be consumed
maxPriorityFeePerGas : max gas to be included as tip to validators
maxFeePerGas : max amount of gas to be paid for the transaction
Areon supports the following Ethereum transactions.

Dynamic Fee Transactions (EIP-1559)
Access List Transactions (EIP-2930)
Legacy Transactions (EIP-2718)
Areon is capable of processing Ethereum transactions by wrapping them on a message. This message encapsulates an Ethereum transaction as an message and contains the necessary transaction data fields.

TX Types
There are three types of transaction types used from Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs):

LegacyTxType (EIP-155): The LegacyTxType represents the original transaction format that existed before Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 155. These transactions do not include a chain ID, which makes them vulnerable to replay attacks. EIP-155 was introduced to solve this problem by incorporating a chain ID, which uniquely identifies a specific Ethereum chain to prevent cross-chain replay attacks.

AccessListTxType (EIP-2930): AccessListTxType was introduced with EIP-2930 as part of the Berlin upgrade. This new transaction type allows users to specify an access list – a list of addresses and storage keys that the transaction plans to access. The primary goal of access lists is to mitigate some of the gas cost increases introduced with EIP-2929, which increased gas costs for state access operations to improve denial-of-service (DoS) attack resistance. By specifying an access list, users can avoid paying higher gas costs for subsequent accesses to the same addresses and storage keys within the same transaction.

DynamicFeeTxType (EIP-1559): DynamicFeeTxType was introduced with EIP-1559 as part of the London upgrade. This transaction type brought significant changes to Ethereum's fee market, with the aim of making gas fees more predictable and improving user experience. EIP-1559 transactions include two main components: a base fee and a priority fee (or tip). The base fee is algorithmically determined by the network, while the priority fee is set by users to incentivize miners to include their transaction. The base fee is burned, effectively reducing the overall ETH supply, while the priority fee goes to miners as a reward for their work. DynamicFeeTxType transactions allow for more predictable and efficient gas fee management. A transaction receipt shows data returned by an Ethereum client to represent the result of a particular transaction, including a hash of the transaction, its block number, the amount of gas used, and, in case of deployment of a smart contract, the address of the contract. Additionally, it includes custom information from the events emitted in the smart contract.

These transaction types represent Ethereum's continuous evolution and improvements to its network, helping address challenges related to scalability, security, and user experience.

Transaction Receipts
A receipt contains the following information:

transactionHash : hash of the transaction
transactionIndex : integer of the transactions index position in the block
blockHash : hash of the block where this transaction was in.
blockNumber : block number where this transaction was in.
from : sender address
to : receiver address (null when its a contract creation transaction)
cumulativeGasUsed : The total amount of gas used when this transaction was executed in the block.
effectiveGasPrice : The sum of the base fee and tip paid per unit of gas.
gasUsed : The amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
contractAddress : The contract address created, if the transaction was a contract creation, otherwise null.
logs : Array of log objects, which this transaction generated
logsBloom : Bloom filter for light clients to quickly retrieve related logs.
type : integer of the transaction type, 0x00 for legacy transactions, 0x01 for access list types, 0x02 for dynamic fees. It also returns either
root : transaction stateroot (pre Byzantium)
status : either 1 (success) or 0 (failure)



# Segments

## Governance
The module enables Areon to support an on-chain governance system. In this system, holders of the AREA of the chain can vote on proposals on a 1 token 1 vote basis. Next is a list of features the module currently supports:

Proposal submission: Users can submit proposals with a deposit. Once the minimum deposit is reached, the proposal enters voting period. The minimum deposit can be reached by collecting deposits from different users (including proposer) within deposit period.

Vote: Participants can vote on proposals that reached MinDeposit and entered voting period.

Inheritance and penalties: Delegators inherit their validator's vote if they don't vote themselves.

Claiming deposit: Users that deposited on proposals can recover their deposits if the proposal was accepted or rejected. If the proposal was vetoed, or never entered voting period (minimum deposit not reached within deposit period), the deposit is burned.

The governance process is divided in a few steps that are outlined below:

Proposal submission: Proposal is submitted to the blockchain with a deposit.
Vote: Once deposit reaches a certain value (MinDeposit), proposal is confirmed and vote opens. Area holders can then send Vote transactions to vote on the proposal.
Execution After a period of time, the votes are tallied and depending on the result, the messages in the proposal will be executed.

Deposit
To prevent spam, proposals must be submitted with a deposit in the coins defined by the MinDeposit param.

When a proposal is submitted, it has to be accompanied with a deposit that must be strictly positive, but can be inferior to MinDeposit.
The submitter doesn't need to pay for the entire deposit on their own. The newly created proposal is stored in an inactive proposal queue and stays there until its deposit passes the MinDeposit.
Other token holders can increase the proposal's deposit by sending a Deposit transaction.
If a proposal doesn't pass the MinDeposit before the deposit end time (the time when deposits are no longer accepted), the proposal will be destroyed: the proposal will be removed from state and the deposit will be burned.
When a proposal deposit passes the MinDeposit threshold (even during the proposal submission) before the deposit end time, the proposal will be moved into the active proposal queue and the voting period will begin.

## Slashing
The slashing module enables Areon to disincentivize any attributable action by a protocol-recognized actor with value at stake by penalizing them ("slashing").

Penalties may include, but are not limited to:

Burning some amount of their stake
Removing their ability to vote on future blocks for a period of time.

## Vesting
This specification outlines the implementation of a vesting account for use within the Areon. The stipulations for this vesting account mandate its genesis initialization with a starting balance (X) and a vesting end time (ET). Optionally, a vesting account may also be configured with a vesting start time (ST) and a specified number of vesting periods (P). If a vesting start time is provided, the vesting period will commence only upon reaching the specified start time. In the case of included vesting periods, the vesting process unfolds over the defined number of periods.

For all vesting accounts, the account owner retains the ability to delegate and undelegate from validators. However, the transfer of coins to another account is restricted until these coins have undergone the vesting process. This specification accommodates three distinct types of vesting:

Delayed Vesting: All coins vest once ET is attained.

Continuous Vesting: Coins initiate vesting at ST, progressing linearly with time until reaching ET.

Periodic Vesting: Coins commence vesting at ST and follow periodic vesting based on the configured number of periods, length per period, and amount per period. A periodic vesting account differs from a continuous vesting account in that coins can be released in staggered tranches. For instance, a periodic vesting account might be employed for arrangements where coins are released quarterly, annually, or following any other temporal distribution of tokens.

Vesting Account Specification
Given a vesting account, we define the following in the proceeding operations:

OV: The original vesting coin amount. It is a constant value.
V: The number of OV coins that are still vesting. It is derived by OV, StartTime and EndTime. This value is computed on demand and not on a per-block basis.
V': The number of OV coins that are vested (unlocked). This value is computed on demand and not a per-block basis.
DV: The number of delegated vesting coins. It is a variable value. It is stored and modified directly in the vesting account.
DF: The number of delegated vested (unlocked) coins. It is a variable value. It is stored and modified directly in the vesting account.
BC: The number of OV coins less any coins that are transferred (which can be negative or delegated). It is considered to be balance of the embedded base account. It is stored and modified directly in the vesting account.
Permanent Locked Accounts
Permanent Locked Accounts refer to accounts within the blockchain ecosystem that are subject to an irreversible locking mechanism. Once an account is designated as permanently locked, it implies that specific conditions or criteria have been met, resulting in a sustained and unrecoverable restriction on the account's functionality. This measure is often implemented for various purposes, such as security, compliance, or contractual agreements.

The permanence of the lock implies that the account will remain inaccessible or restricted indefinitely, and the associated assets or functionalities within that account are effectively frozen. The criteria for triggering permanent lock status may vary and could include security breaches, violation of terms, or adherence to specific smart contract conditions.

It's essential for users and participants in the blockchain network to be aware of the implications and conditions leading to permanent locked accounts, as this mechanism plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the decentralized ecosystem.

Example:

{
    "@type": "/vesting.PermanentLockedAccount",
    "base_vesting_account": {
    "base_account": {
        "address": "areon1rapp8staxr6nc5v8u9ljfe5acwd4ux5uz30383",
        "pub_key": null,
        "account_number": "20",
        "sequence": "0"
    },
    "original_vesting": [
        {
        "denom": "area",
        "amount": "1000"
        }
    ],
    "delegated_free": [],
    "delegated_vesting": [],
    "end_time": "0"
    }
}

Periodic Vesting Accounts
Periodic Vesting Accounts:

Periodic Vesting Accounts are a specialized type of financial instrument within the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency. These accounts are structured to facilitate the controlled release of assets over predefined intervals, offering a systematic approach to distributing vested funds.

Key Features:

Vesting Commencement: Periodic vesting accounts initiate their vesting process at a specified start time (ST). This feature allows for a predetermined delay before the vesting begins, aligning with project milestones or contractual obligations.

Configurable Parameters: These accounts are highly configurable, allowing users to define the number of vesting periods (P), the duration of each period, and the amount of assets vested per period. This flexibility accommodates various token release strategies tailored to the project's needs.

Staggered Release: A distinctive feature of periodic vesting is the ability to release vested assets in staggered tranches. This enables project teams to implement structured and phased token releases, ensuring a steady and controlled distribution over time.

Use Cases: Periodic vesting accounts find application in scenarios where a gradual release of funds aligns with project development milestones, partnership agreements, or compliance requirements. For example, funds might be released quarterly, annually, or according to other predefined schedules.

Transparency and Predictability: By providing a transparent and predictable schedule for asset releases, periodic vesting accounts contribute to enhanced accountability and trust within the blockchain ecosystem. Users can anticipate and plan for upcoming releases with confidence.

Understanding and effectively utilizing periodic vesting accounts play a pivotal role in managing token economies, fostering responsible financial practices, and building trust among stakeholders in blockchain projects.

Example:

 {
  "@type": "/vesting.PeriodicVestingAccount",
  "base_vesting_account": {

          "amount": "25000000000000000000000000"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "length": "5000",
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "area",
          "amount": "25000000000000000000000000"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "length": "10000",
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "area",
          "amount": "25000000000000000000000000"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "length": "15000",
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "area",
          "amount": "25000000000000000000000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Delayed/Discrete Vesting Accounts
Delayed vesting accounts are easier to reason about as they only have the full amount vesting up until a certain time, then all the coins become vested (unlocked). This does not include any unlocked coins the account may have initially.

Transferring/Sending
At any given time, a vesting account may transfer: min((BC + DV) - V, BC).

In other words, a vesting account may transfer the minimum of the base account balance and the base account balance plus the number of currently delegated vesting coins less the number of coins vested so far.



# Testnet

## What is a testnet?
As the word suggests, a testnet is a test network. Developers use a testing platform to try their codes, the chain’s transactions, new apps and much more.

While a testnet is often used before a mainnet, sometimes developers open a test platform after the mainnet to try new things in a risk-free environment.

Developers may use it to try new functions and measure the performance. If there is an error, they can fix it easily without hurting the mainnet.

What are the benefits of a testnet?
Besides the obvious benefits of testing functions and performance, test networks are also vital to prevent any interruptions to users’ interactions or assets.

Coins or tokens in a testnet environment have no value.

Tokens are only used for simulations. This is an excellent way for our developers to fix bugs and improve the chain in a safe way.

Why should you join Testnet?
When users join Areon testnet, they will explore the speed and functionality of Areon Chain for the first time. Based on the feedback, we can fix and improve things before going live.

You can join it for free and see Areon Chain in action for the first time.

Mainnet vs. Testnet: What is the difference?
While the difference may sound obvious, it is important to list the facts for further clarification:

Testnet	Mainnet
Purpose	A simulation for testing chain performance, spotting errors and proving the functions via testers’ help	A live platform for smart contracts, dApps, live transactions and generating new coins for the chain.
Features	Same or more features than mainnet, if developers are testing a new function.	Same features for regular blockchain functions.
Staking	No direct economic benefits from chain activities. Areon testers will receive rewards and gifts for participating	Based on Proof of Area consensus, validators will receive rewards for proving transactions.
Coins	Coins or tokens on a testnet are for simulation purposes. They don’t have any value.	Coins and tokens on a mainnet have real value.
Network IDs	Testnet has a unique and different network id.	Mainnet has a unique and different network id.
Wallets	Your testnet wallet will be separate and different. You cannot swap assets from test network to main network.	Your mainnet wallet will be different. You cannot receive assets from your testnet wallet to the mainnet wallet.

## How to Join Testnet?
In this brief guide, we will explain how to participate in the event. Before we dive in, please remember these key principles:

The participation is free.
DO NOT share your account or wallet information that contains real assets with anyone.
Testnet assets (tokens, coins, NFTs) are for test purposes; they hold no value

Step 1: Visit https://areon.network website
On our official website, you will find a button that will take you to the testnet page. Click the button and go to our testnet page. Please check that your browser URL address is correct. It must be https://areon.network

If you are in doubt, google “areon network” or find our official social media channels with verified accounts, such as Twitter or Telegram accounts. You will find the correct links there.

Eventually, you will arrive here:


Step 2: Press Connect Wallet Button

Now, you are on our testnet page.

When you are ready, start by connecting your wallet.

Once you click the Connect Wallet button in the top right corner, your Web3 wallet (such as Metamask or Trust wallet) will save the necessary information about our test network.

Proceed to grant it access, confirm and let it switch to the Areon test network.

Please Note: Areon Wallet is not a standalone product. It doesn’t have an app or browser extension yet. Thus, you need another Web3 wallet such as Metamask or Trust wallet to initiate the testnet.

Tip: You can import your testnet wallet into AreonWallet at any time! AreonWallet awaits you on the AreonScan page. You just need to import it.

Step 3: Start Testing

Testnet tasks are a series of transactions that you can perform on a daily basis. For each task completed, you will receive AREA Points. The more AREA Points you collect, the higher your testnet score is. We will keep a leaderboard of participants, so that you can check your ranking at any time. Once your wallet is connected to the test network, these tasks will be available for you.

(Optional) Step 4: Import your Web3 wallet to AreonWallet

This is an optional step if you wish to test AreonWallet as well.

When you visit the AreonScan page, the dedicated scanner of Areon Network, you will notice a drawer panel on your right hand side.

It is the AreonWallet!


Click to activate it. Let’s import your testnet account from the Web3 wallet.

Select an option for importing your Web3 wallet here.
Available options are Mnemonic phrase, Private key and Keystore.

Give your Areon Wallet a cool name and set a secure password.
Use the password to log back into Areon Wallet after some time.

Once completed, you can use Areon Wallet the same way you use your existing Web3 wallet.
Step 5: Keep performing tasks on Testnet
Testnet gives our developers a crucial insight as to how the Areon Chain performs under pressure.

By taking part in the event, you will be helping Areon Network get better.

As the testnet continues, we will be publishing new tasks for you to complete. Thus, it is crucial for us that you continue participating in them.

Zealy Tasks
With testnet, we are adding new Zealy quests to our ongoing sprint.

The points you earn in this sprint will bring you Areon Points in the testnet. We will explain how Zealy XP will convert to Area Points later on.

Zealy tasks are a series of fun, simple quests that need your attention briefly each day.

Don’t forget to check Areon Zealy Quest Board for updates!

## Faucet
Faucet is an online service that gives away a certain cryptocurrency (TAREA for Areon) for free to users. Faucets are created to help new users looking to get acquainted with the world of cryptocurrencies or developers wanting to conduct test transactions. By essentially distributing small amounts of free cryptocurrency, they allow users to gain experience and use cryptocurrency wallets. Faucets typically offer limited amounts of cryptocurrency per transaction or within a specific time frame. This service can serve as a simple starting point for those interested in entering the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

## Technical Architecture
Areon is a scalable Proof of Area blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is built using base libraries which runs on top of the Tendermint Core consensus engine, to accomplish fast finality, high transaction throughput and short block times (~1.3 seconds).

This architecture allows users to perform both Areon and EVM formatted transactions, developers to scale dApps, and tokens and assets in the network to come from different independent sources.

Areon enables these key features by:

Implementing Tendermint Core to manage the blockchain. Utilizing geth as a library to promote code reuse and improve maintainability. Exposing a fully compatible Web3 JSON-RPC layer for interacting with existing Ethereum clients and tooling (Metamask, Remix, Truffle, etc). The sum of these features allows developers to leverage existing Ethereum ecosystem tools and software to seamlessly deploy smart contracts within Areon.

EVM Compatibility
Areon enables EVM compatibility by implementing various components that together support all the EVM state transitions while ensuring the same developer experience as Ethereum:

JSON-RPC client for interacting with the EVM Ethereum's transaction format as a Areon Tx interface Ethereum's secp256k1 curve for the Areon Keys StateDB interface for state updates and queries

## Smart Contracts
Since the introduction of Ethereum in 2015, the ability to control digital assets through smart contracts has attracted a large community of developers to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This community is continuously creating extensive tooling and introducing standards, which are further increasing the adoption rate of EVM-compatible technology.

Whether you are building new use cases on Areon or porting an existing dApp from another EVM-based chain (e.g. Ethereum), you can easily build and deploy EVM smart contracts on Areon to implement the core business logic of your dApp. Areon is fully compatible with the EVM, so it allows you to use the same tools (Solidity, Remix, Oracles, etc.) and APIs (i.e. Ethereum JSON-RPC) that are available on the EVM.

Leveraging the interoperability of Cosmos chains, Areon enables you to build scalable cross-chain applications within a familiar EVM environment. Learn about the essential components when building and deploying EVM smart contracts on Areon below.

Build with Solidity
You can develop EVM smart contracts on Areon using Solidity. Solidity is also used to build smart contracts on Ethereum. So if you have deployed smart contracts on Ethereum (or any other EVM-compatible chain) you can use the same contracts on Areon.

Since it is the most widely used smart contract programming language in Blockchain, Solidity comes with well-documented and rich language support. Head over to our list of Tools and IDE Plugins to help you get started.

EVM Extensions
EVM Extensions are precompiled contracts that are built into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each offers specific functionality, that can be used by other smart contracts. Generally, they are used to perform operations that are either not possible or would be too expensive to perform with a regular smart contract implementation, such as hashing, elliptic curve cryptography, and modular exponentiation.

By adding custom EVM extensions to Ethereum's basic feature set, Areon allows developers to use previously unavailable functionality in smart contracts, like staking and governance operations. This will allow more complex smart contracts to be built on Areon and further improves the interoperability between Cosmos and Ethereum. It also is a key feature to achieve Areon' vision of being the definitive dApp chain, where any dApp can be deployed once and users can interact with a wide range of different blockchains natively.

To enable the described functionalities, Areon introduces so-called stateful precompiled smart contracts, which can perform a state transition, as opposed to those offered by the standard Go-Ethereum implementation, which can only read state information. This is necessary because an operation like e.g. staking tokens will ultimately change the chain state.

Oracles
Blockchain oracles provide a way for smart contracts to access external information, such as price feeds from financial exchanges or carbon emission measurements. They serve as bridges between blockchains and the outside world.

Deploy with Ethereum JSON-RPC
Areon is fully compatible with the Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs, allowing you to deploy and interact with smart contracts on Areon and connect with existing Ethereum-compatible web3 tooling. This gives you direct access to reading Ethereum-formatted transactions or sending them to the network which otherwise wouldn't be possible on a Cosmos chain, such as Areon.

You can connect to the Areon Testnet to deploy and test your smart contracts before moving to Mainnet.

Block Explorers
You can use AreonScan to view and debug interactions with your smart contracts deployed on Areon. Block explorers index blocks and their transactions so that you can search for real-time and historical information about the blockchain, including data related to blocks, transactions, addresses, and more.

Contract Verification
Once deployed, smart contract data is deployed as non-human readable EVM bytecode. You can use contract verification tools or apply for contract verification on AreonScan to publish and verify your original Solidity code to prove to users that they are interacting with the correct smart contract.



# Validator

## What is Validator ?
A blockchain validator is a critical component of a blockchain network responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks added to the blockchain. Validators play a central role in ensuring the security, integrity, and consensus of a blockchain network. Here's an overview description of blockchain validators:

Transaction Verification: Validators are responsible for checking the validity of transactions submitted to the blockchain. They verify that the sender has sufficient funds, the transaction adheres to the network's rules, and the digital signatures are valid.

Consensus Protocol Participation: Validators participate in the blockchain's consensus protocol, which is a set of rules or algorithms that determine how new blocks are added to the blockchain. Popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of AREA (PoA), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Work (PoW), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and more. Validators may take on different roles within these mechanisms, such as block proposers or voters.

Block Validation: Once a block is proposed by a miner or validator, other validators in the network verify its legitimacy. They check that the block contains valid transactions, adheres to the network's rules, and doesn't contain any double-spending attempts or other malicious activities.

Node Operation: Validators operate network nodes that maintain a copy of the blockchain ledger. These nodes continuously sync with the network, update the blockchain, and ensure the accuracy and consistency of the ledger. Validators must be online and operational to participate effectively in the consensus process.

Staking and Incentives: In PoS and DPoS-based networks, validators often need to "stake" a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral to participate in the consensus and validation process. They are rewarded with transaction fees and block rewards in return for their services. Validators have a financial incentive to act honestly and follow the rules to maintain their reputation and rewards.

Network Security: Validators contribute to the overall security of the blockchain network. By participating in consensus and maintaining the blockchain ledger, they help prevent various attacks, including double spending and 51% attacks.

Decentralization: In many blockchain networks, decentralization is a key goal. Validators are distributed across the network to avoid central points of failure and control. This decentralization ensures the network's resilience and trustworthiness.

Role Customization: Depending on the blockchain network and consensus mechanism, validators may have different roles and responsibilities. Some may be involved in block proposal, while others focus on block validation and voting.

In summary, blockchain validators are crucial actors in blockchain ecosystems, ensuring the integrity, security, and consensus of the network. They contribute to the decentralization and reliability of blockchain networks while being incentivized to act honestly and fairly in validating transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain.

Introduction
Areon is built on Tendermint, which relies on a set of validators that are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain. These validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key. Validators can bond their own AREA and have AREA "delegated", or staked, with them by token holders.

Areon will have 50 validators, but over time this will increase to 100 validators according to a predefined schedule. The minimum amount required for a validator to join the network is $AREA 100,000. Validators are ranked according to the amount of AREA staked with them the top 50 validator candidates with the most stake will become active validators. Validators and their delegators will earn AREA as block rewards and transaction fees through execution of the Tendermint consensus protocol. Initially, transaction fees will be paid in AREA but in the future, any token in the Areon ecosystem will be valid as a fee tender if it is whitelisted by governance. Note that validators can set the commission on the fees their delegators receive as an additional incentive.

If validators double sign, are frequently offline or do not participate in governance, their AREA staked (including AREA of users that delegated to them) may be slashed. The penalty depends on the severity of the violation.

Minimum System Requirements
We expect that a modest level of hardware specifications is initially needed and might rise as network use increases. Participating in the testnet is the best way to learn more.

The following hardware requirements are expected:

Pruning	Storage	RAM	CPU
everything	~100 GB	8 GB	4-core
default	~1.5 TB	16 GB	4-core
nothing	~2.8 TB+	32 GB	8-core
Hardware
There are currently no existing appropriate cloud solution for validator key management. For this reason, validators must set up a physical operation secured with restricted access. A good starting place, for example, would be co-locating in secure data centers. Validators should expect to equip their datacenter location with excess power, connectivity, and storage backups. Expect to have several excess networking boxes for fiber, firewall, switching and small servers with excess hard drives. Hardware can be on the low end of datacenter gear to start out with. We expect network requirements to be low initially. The current testnet requires minimal resources. Then bandwidth, CPU and memory requirements will rise as the network grows. Large hard drives are recommended for storing years of blockchain history.

Set Up a Website
Set up a dedicated validator's website and signal your intention of becoming a validator on our blockchain network. This is important since delegators will want to have more available information about the entity they are delegating their area to.

## Disk Usage Optimization
Customize the configuration settings to lower the disk requirements for your validator node.

Blockchain database tends to grow over time, depending e.g. on block speed and transaction amount. For Areon, we are talking about close to 100GB of disk usage in first one month.

There are few configurations that can be done to reduce the required disk usage quite significantly. Some of these changes take full effect only when you do the configuration and start syncing from start with them in use.

Indexing
If you do not need to query transactions from the specific node, you can disable indexing. On config.toml set

indexer = "null"

If you do this on already synced node, the collected index is not purged automatically, you need to delete it manually.

State-Sync Snapshots
I believe this was disabled by default on Areon, but listing it in any case here. On app.toml set

snapshot-interval = 0

Note that if state-sync was enabled on the network and working properly, it would allow one to sync a new node in few minutes. But this node would not have the history.

Configure Pruning
By default every 500th state, and the last 100 states are kept. This consumes a lot of disk space on long run, and can be optimized with following custom configuration:

pruning = "custom"
pruning-keep-recent = "100"
pruning-interval = "10"

Configuring pruning-keep-recent = "0" might sound tempting, but this will risk database corruption if the Areond is killed for any reason. Thus, it is recommended to keep the few latest states.

Logging
By default the logging level is set to info, and this produces a lot of logs. This log level might be good when starting up to see that the node starts syncing properly. However, after you see the syncing is going smoothly, you can lower the log level to warn (or error). On config.toml set the following

log_level = "warn"

Also ensure your log rotation is configured properly.

## Configuration
Peers
You can set your peers in config.toml.

Below are examples of how you can add persistent peers, they are just examples, do not use them.

persistent_peers = "9f48e9346bc2a3a812b324e8568bdd8a869cacc2@0.0.0.0:26656"

areoncli tendermint show-node-id
4761aa4379ebfc5adeb9c385b4f3a09cc2664cf0

Format: node-id@server-ip:port

Example Peer: ac29d21d0a6885465048a4481d16c12f59b2e58b@0.0.0.0:26656

Validator Backup
Ensuring the security of your validator node is of paramount importance, and a key aspect of this is the diligent backup of your validator's private key. This private key holds significant value as it serves as the exclusive means to restore your validator in the unfortunate event of a disaster. Specifically, it is a Tendermint Key, a distinctive cryptographic key that plays a crucial role in signing consensus votes.

Recognizing the pivotal nature of this key underscores the importance of establishing robust backup practices, safeguarding the continuity and integrity of your validator node.

So be sure to make a backup of this key, here is the file path where you can find the key:

~/.areonchaindatadir/config/priv_validator_key.json

## What is a validator?
Areon is built on Tendermint, which relies on a set of validators to secure the network. The role of validators is to run a full-node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by their private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work. They must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.

What is staking?
The Areon is a Delegated Proof of Area (PoA) blockchain, meaning that the weight of validators is determined by the total amount of staking tokens (AREA) bonded as collateral. These AREA can be self-delegated directly by the validator or delegated to them by other AREA holders. Any user in the system can declare their intention to become a validator by sending a create validator transaction, provided they meet the minimum self-delegated amount of 100.000 AREA. From there, they become validator candidates. The weight (i.e. voting power) of a validator determines whether or not they are an active validator. Initially, only the top 50 validators with the most voting power will be active validators.

Incentives
What is the incentive to stake?
There are essentailly 2 different types of revenue:

Block rewards: Native tokens of applications run by validators (e.g. AREA on Areon) are inflated to produce block provisions. These provisions exist to incentivize AREA holders to bond their stake, as non-bonded AREA will be diluted over time.
Transaction fees: Areon maintains a whitelist of token that are accepted as fee payment. The initial fee token is the AREA.
What is the incentive to run a validator?
Validators earn proportionally more revenue than their delegators because of commissions.

Validators also play a major role in governance. If a delegator does not vote, they inherit the vote from their validator. This gives validators a major responsibility in the ecosystem.

What are validators commission?
Revenue received by a validator's pool is split between the validator and their delegators. The validator can apply a commission on the part of the revenue that goes to their delegators. This commission is set as a percentage. Each validator is free to set their initial commission, maximum daily commission change rate and maximum commission. Areon enforces the parameter that each validator sets. Only the commission rate can change after the validator is created.

How are blocks rewards distributed?
Block rewards are distributed proportionally to all validators relative to their voting power. This means that even though each validator gains AREA with each reward, all validators will maintain equal weight over time.

Let us take an example where we have 10 validators with equal voting power and a commission rate of 1%. Let us also assume that the reward for a block is 1000 AREA and that each validator has 20% of self-bonded AREA. These tokens do not go directly to the proposer. Instead, they are evenly distributed among validators based on their total weight. So now each validator's pool has 100 AREA. These 100 AREA will be distributed according to each participant's stake:

Commission: 100 * 80% * 1% = 0.8
Validator gets: 100 * 20% + commission = 20.8
All delegators get: 100 * 80% - commision = 79.2
Then, each delegator can claim their part of the 79.2 AREA in proportion to their stake in the validator's staking pool.

How are fees distributed?
Fees are similarly distributed with the exception that the block proposer can get a bonus on the fees of the block they propose if they include more than the minimum number of required precommits.

When a validator is selected to propose the next block, they must include at least 2/3 precommits of the previous block. However, there is an incentive to include more than 2/3 precommits in the form of a bonus. The bonus is linear: it ranges from 1% if the proposer includes 2/3rd precommits (minimum for the block to be valid) to 5% if the proposer includes 100% precommits. Of course the proposer should not wait too long or other validators may timeout and move on to the next proposer. As such, validators have to find a balance between the waiting time to get the most signatures and the risk of losing out on proposing the next block. This mechanism aims to incentivize non-empty block proposals, better networking between validators as well as to mitigate censorship.

What are the slashing condiditons?
If a validator misbehaves, their delegated stake will be partially slashed. There are currently two conditions that can result in slashing of funds for a validator and their delegators:

Double Signing: If someone reports on chain A that a validator signed two blocks at the same height on chain A and chain B, and if chain A and chain B share a common ancestor, then this validator will get slashed by 5% on chain A. Validators who double sign will be jailed and CANNOT be unjailed thereafter.
Downtime: If a validator misses more than 95% of the last 10000 blocks, they will get slashed by 0.1%. Validators may unjail their validators after a 600s (10minute) window.
Technical Requirements
What are hardware requirements?
Validators should expect to provision one or more data center locations with redundant power, networking, firewalls, HSMs and servers.

We expect that a modest level of hardware specifications will be needed initially and that they might rise as network use increases. Participating in the testnet is the best way to learn more.

What are software requirements?
In addition to running an Areon node, validators should develop monitoring, alerting and management solutions.

What are bandwidth requirements?
Areon has the capacity for very high throughput compared to chains like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

As such, we recommend that the data center nodes only connect to trusted full nodes in the cloud or other validators that know each other socially. This relieves the data center node from the burden of mitigating denial-of-service attacks.

Ultimately, as the network becomes more used, one can realistically expect daily bandwidth on the order of several gigabytes.

What does running a validator imply in terms of logistics?
A successful validator operation will require the efforts of multiple highly skilled individuals and continuous operational attention. This will be considerably more involved than running a bitcoin miner for instance.

What are the maintenance requirements?
Validators should expect to perform regular software updates to accommodate upgrades and bug fixes. There will inevitably be issues with the network early in its bootstrapping phase that will require substantial vigilance.

How can validators protect themselves from a Denial of Service attack?
Denial-of-service attacks occur when an attacker sends a flood of internet traffic to an IP address to prevent the server at the IP address from connecting to the internet.

An attacker scans the network, tries to learn the IP address of various validator nodes and disconnect them from communication by flooding them with traffic.

One recommended way to mitigate these risks is for validators to carefully structure their network topology in a so-called sentry node architecture.

Validator nodes should only connect to full-nodes they trust because they operate them themselves or are run by other validators they know socially. A validator node will typically run in a data center. Most data centers provide direct links the networks of major cloud providers. The validator can use those links to connect to sentry nodes in the cloud. This shifts the burden of denial-of-service from the validator's node directly to its sentry nodes, and may require new sentry nodes be spun up or activated to mitigate attacks on existing ones.

Sentry nodes can be quickly spun up or change their IP addresses. Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an internet based attacked cannot disturb them directly. This will ensure validator block proposals and votes always make it to the rest of the network.

It is expected that good operating procedures on that part of validators will completely mitigate these threats.



# Delegator

## What is delegator ?
People who cannot or do not want to operate validator nodes can still participate in the staking process as delegators. Active validators are chosen and ranked based on their total overall AREA staked (this is the sum of their self-delegated stake as well as their delegators' stake). They are by no means solely chosen by their self-delegated stake. This is an important property and acts as a safeguard against validators that are bad actors. In a decentralized ecosystem, if a validator is a bad actor, delegators will undelegate their AREA from them to avoid incurring any slashings of their delegated stake. Good actors will invariably have more AREA delegated to them. Game theory dictates that over time, validators who are bad actors will exit the active validator set whilst good actors will remain or climb higher up the ranks, eventually resulting in a stable and secure ecosystem.

Delegators share the revenue of their validators, but they also share the risks. In terms of revenue, validators and delegators differ in that validators can apply a commission on the revenue that goes to their delegator before it is distributed. This commission is known to delegators beforehand and can only be changed according to predefined constraints.

In terms of risks, delegators' AREA will be slashed if their validator misbehaves.

To become delegators, AREA holders need to send a "Delegate transaction" where they specify the amount of AREA they want to stake and with which validator. A list of validators will be displayed in AreonScan. Subsequently, if a delegator wants to unbond part or all of their stake, they will need to send an "Unbond transaction". Delegators will have to wait for 10 days to retrieve their AREA after sending an "Unbond Transaction". Delegators can also send a "Redelegate Transaction" to switch from one validator to another, without having to go through the 10 days waiting period.

Choosing a validator
In order to choose their validators, delegators have access to a range of information directly in AreonScan.

Validator's moniker: Name of the validator.
Validator's description: Description provided by the validator's operator.
Validator's website: Link to the validator's website.
Initial commission rate: The commission rate on revenue charged to any delegator by the validator.
Commission max change rate: The maximum daily increase of the validator's commission. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
Maximum commission: The maximum commission rate this validator candidate can charge. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
Minimum self-bond amount: Minimum amount of AREA the validator candidate need to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-bonded stake falls below this limit, their entire staking pool (i.e. all its delegators) will unbond. This parameter exists as a safeguard for delegators. Indeed, when a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake gets slashed. This included the validator's self-delegateds stake as well as their delegators' stake. Thus, a validator with a high amount of self-delegated AREA has more skin-in-the-game than a validator with a low amount. The minimum self-bonded parameter guarantees delegators that a validator will never fall below a certain amount of self-bonded stake, thereby ensuring a minimum level of skin-in-the-game. This parameter can only be increased by the validator operator.

Being a delegator is not a passive task. Here are the main directives of a delegator:

Perform careful due diligence on validators before delegating. If a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake, which includes the stake of their delegators, will be slashed. Delegators should therefore select validators carefully and to their own research on who they are delegating to.
Actively monitor their validator after having delegated. Delegators should ensure that the validators they delegate to does not misbehave, meaning that they have good uptime, do not double sign or get compromised, and participate in governance. They should also monitor the commission rate that is being applied to the revenue they are receiving. If a delegator is not satisfied with its validator, they can unbond or rebond and switch to another validator (Note: Delegators do not have to wait for the unbonding period to switch validators. Rebonding takes effect immediately).
Participate in governance. Delegators can and are expected to participate actively in governance. A delegator's voting power is proportional to the size of their bonded stake. If a delegator does not vote, they will inherit the vote of their validator(s). If they do vote, they override the vote of their validator(s).
Redelegation
You can easily re-allocate your stake from one validator to another without having to wait 10 days to unbond. However, there's a limit or catch to this relegation feature.

10 Day Cooldown: Remember this recurring number

When a user requests to undelegate from a validator, the amount of AREA that was requested for undelegation will be locked in unbonding state for 10 days. For simplicity, we call this the 10 day cooldown. After the 10 day cooldown passes, a user will be able to make transactions with the AREA that was previously in unbonding state. This cooldown also applies to certain scenarios in redelegation. In order to redelegate a portion of delegated AREA from Validator A → Validator B, there are two options a user could choose from.

Option #1

Undelegate from Validator A and wait for the 10 day unbonding period (cooldown) to pass. Then, delegate the AREA to Validator B.

Taking this path may seem un-wise because you’ll have to wait 10 days to delegate that stake with another validator. This is where the redelegation feature comes in handy.
Option #2

Use the redelegation feature to immediately redelegate the AREA from Validator A → Validator B.

This redelegation feature seems wonderful. You no longer have to wait 10 days to unbond and then delegate that stake to another validator. But there’s a catch.

## Became Delegator

Here is stories from our AreonNFT series; AreonCity... A city ahead of technology

The first inhabitants of this city are Areonians. Step into a new world with them. Let them introduce the city to you. This city was theirs until now. Now is the time to build and develop together. Explore the city with its architects. This city has different stories in it. There are special stories in this city, such as Ariesman, who is a scientist in the laboratory during the day and a DJ in the most popular nightclub of Areon City in the evenings, or Axolotl, whose broken heart is not repaired even though every damaged organ is recovered.Let's take a closer look at these stories together.

Alligator: Although he is feared at first sight with his long jaw and sharp teeth, he is one of the most beautiful colors in this city. He broke out of every mold he was in. He never hide his identity and was always proud of it. Although most of his life is spent in difficulties and loneliness, he is waiting for the rainbow that will come after that rain.

Ariesman: Areon City's leading scientist. He is also the most loved DJ of Areon City.He is at the microscope in the morning and at the turntable in the evening. He never loses his desire to be the best at two completely different things his business. So which one will you meet? Scientist Ariesman or DJ Ariesmen?

Axolotl: No matter how much he resembles Master Yoda, he is a unique hero of this city. Its different physiology makes it very different. It has a structure that can constantly renew itself and quickly heal damaged organs and limbs. What about a broken heart? No external factor can harm him. Except love...

Crab: Crab, one of the founders of the city, is one of the oldest inhabitants of this city. 3 groups built Areon City together. More precisely, the friendship of the 3 groups created this city from scratch, but this friendship ended because of the secret that will remain between the three. Crab felt betrayed and went into a solitary retreat.

Fireman: The rebel boy of the city. He knows Areon City like the back of his hand, but always travels alone. You can meet Fireman, who likes to be alone, on any street. You can come across a different hair color every time you see it. So, which color haired Fireman will you meet?

Jellyfish: While living a quiet life in the seas of Areon City, he fell victim to an interesting experiment by Ariesman. But it wasn't just the appearance that changed. His identity has also changed with his appearance. He only has a vengeance towards Ariesman. The strange smile on his face reminds us of the bad characters in the movies

Octopus: Octopus is a very different character from all of them. You can see him one day taking his sailor hat and traveling to different lands, or having fun in a bar until the morning. He who enjoys life to the fullest and life is actually a big smile for him. So which Octopus will you get? Will you take a new trip to the seas with him or drink tequila together on a Mexican night?

Penguin: She's sweet and cute looking, well-liked by everyone in the city. He is a child who has place in everyone's heart with his smile and sweet appearance. What if it isn't? What if there's a different story behind her sweet looks? He has a friendship with Shark that no one knows about, and they act together. What's Penguin's plan for this city with the Shark he's been hiding from everyone?

Prince: He is the most idealist of the group of 3 who founded this city with Crab. He designed every inch of Areon City and brought it together with technology. He believed in the New World Order and approached the city from a completely different perspective. Although his futuristic thoughts disturb most groups, he does not seem to give up on the path he believes in.

Sea Lion: Sea Lion actually gives off a dad vibe to anyone who sees him. If you follow him one day and watch him, you can see that he is actually a teenager. Despite his age, you can see that he skates better than the younger ones at the skate park. He is doing his best to catch up and enjoy life, even if it is late.

Seahorse: Another founder of Areon City is Seahorse. He has a wise and traditional personality. As Prince reflects the futuristic side of this city, he also reflects the traditional side of this city. The deterioration of his old friendship with Crab after the city was founded affected him deeply, and he never resurfaced. He now rules the seas of Areon City and maintains peace.

Sea Turtle: Prince's Xman guards Areon City's visible face, while Sea Tutle guards its seas. He may seem childish and sweet, he is actually a fearless warrior. It provides safety in the seas of the city in the shadow of the Seahorse. A poor boy who misses his family as much as he is a fearless warrior. He is looking for his family who disappeared years ago. Hope is what sustains him. He always keeps the hope

Shark: The owner of the underworld and Xman's only enemy. He wants to control this city. He wants to be the owner of the order, not a part of the order. The good and bad battle with Xman is worth seeing. Areon City's unresolved rivalry. Remember that every villain has a story that makes it villian. So what's Shark's story?

X Man: He was commissioned by the Prince to guard the city. Protector of the city and order. It is one of the most important reasons for Areon City's peaceful life. What if anyone is bothered by this order? The fight against Shark, who says the best order is disorder, has been going on since the city was founded. And it seems like it will never end.

MetAreon
We are excited to follow the adoption of NFTs in many parts of the world. The use of NFT has always been difficult to date due to high costs, even though we live in a world where blockchain technology is used effectively, there are ecosystems that are still not fully functional, with technical limitations for users.

Areon's vision is; Making NFTs much easier to use, trade, and create as we enable greater adoption and significantly increase the volume of the NFT World, with our faster and more cost-effective solutions. We are building a scalable cross-chain token network.

Setting out with the motto of being a pioneer in the field of NFT, MetAreon started working with leading NFT artists and collectors in this field 1 year before its launch. In this process, where we identify the deficiencies and needs in the sector, our continuously growing professional team is focused on solving this problem. We are creating a unique ecosystem.

A Unique NFT Experience! You are rewarded with $AREA for every transaction made in the MetAreon. Buy NFT from the world's best artists or let your imagination run wild to be among the world's best artists. Artists receive royalties for all ongoing secondary sales of their works at the rate they set for each sale, forever.

Our continuously growing professional team has been working on the shortcomings and needs in the NFT ecosystem for 1 year. We have worked for a long time to build the most unique and easiest bridge between artists and art enthusiasts, and we continue to do so.

Our Core Team carefully selects and approves artists and NFT projects. Artists are responsible for promoting and selling their work to collectors. However, we think that the artists are not getting the support they deserve in terms of marketing and sales. We support artists who are committed to the arts and produce visibly unique works of art.

# Tokenomics
What is a tokenomics model?
It is a fusion of the terms "token" and "economics". Tokenomics serves as a comprehensive framework for understanding the factors that contribute to a cryptocurrency's value and appeal to investors.

This encompasses a range of elements, from the supply of the token and its issuance method to its specific use-cases.

Understanding tokenomics is crucial for an investor when evaluating a blockchain project. Purchasing and retaining tokens over an extended period are generally more sustainable and successful if the project has a well-developed and well-planned token ecosystem.

A robust platform often leads to increased demand over time, attracting new investors and subsequently driving up prices.

Similarly, when initiating a new project, founders and developers must meticulously assess the tokenomics of their native digital currency to ensure it draws investment and achieves success.

Key Aspects of Tokenomics
The economic architecture of a cryptocurrency defines the incentives that motivate investors to acquire and hold a particular coin or token. The most important aspects are Token Allocation and Vesting Periods.

Many cryptocurrency initiatives have a well-defined plan for the allocation of tokens. Frequently, a designated quantity of tokens is set aside for stakeholders like venture capitalists or developers. However, the caveat is that these tokens can only be liquidated after a specified duration.

This, in turn, influences the coin's circulating supply over time. The optimal scenario is when a project's team has devised a distribution strategy that minimizes the impact on both the circulating supply and the token's market value as much as feasible.

Areon Network's Token Allocation and Vesting Pools

Areon Network has a dedicated token allocation model with clearly defined vesting periods.

Category	Allocation	AREA	The Unlock / Launch	Cliff / Month	Vesting
Ecosystem Development	30%	75.000.000	50%	12	120 Months Linear
Community	20%	50.000.000	60%	12	60 Months Linear
Backers	10%	25.000.000	0%	12	120 Months Linear
Team	10%	25.000.000	0%	12	48 Months Linear
Public Sale	10%	25.000.000	100%	0	0
Listing & Equity	10%	25.000.000	60%	12	48 Months Linear
Company Reserve	10%	25.000.000	60%	12	72 Months Linear
TOTAL	100%	250.000.000	122.500.000	=	=
Our network has a Total Supply of 250 Million.

30% Ecosystem Development:
This signals a sharp focus on the long-term growth of our project. Any new product that will be developed on Areon Chain will be boosted by this decision.

Additionally, an Emergency Fund will be allocated to address any potential attacks that may occur on Areonchain, and it will also be made available to the Areon Team for the operational needs of running validators until they are certain that everything is running smoothly. This allocation has a 120 months linear vesting period. 75 Million coins are locked for this purpose.

20% Community:
This allocation is aimed at community engagement and rewards. As a decentralized project, Areon Network is primarily focused on community development and empowering the broad expanse of our audience.

This allocation has a 60 months linear vesting period with 50 Million coins locked.

10% Backers:
For the major supporters and investors of the project that will be decided by the Areon team, keeping in mind the best interest of the project.

This allocation has a 120 months linear vesting period with 25 Million coins locked.

10% Team:
The share of the Areon team, locked away for a predefined period until the project matures.

The allocation for this purpose is 48 months and with a total of 25 Million vested coins.

10% Public Sales:
There is no locked duration for this item which is worth 25 Million AREA coins.

10% Listing & Liquidity:
We set aside another 25 Million AREA coins for listing expenses and liquidity purposes.

It is important to note that Areon Network is extremely careful when selecting listing and partnership offers. We carefully select top tier exchanges for our project for negotiations.

The vesting period is 48 months.

10% Company Reserve:
The final item on our token distribution scheme. 25 Million AREAs are locked and set aside for a 72-months period as company reserves.

Our Deflationary Approach
With Areonchain, we will have a total supply of 250 million AREA. Thanks to its excellent deflationary mechanism, burning will occur on the last day of each quarter, a total of 4 times a year. The burning will be directly proportional to the transactions on Areonchain. This algorithm will continue to operate until the total supply reaches 100 million AREA.

Our goal is to maintain and uphold a fair value for AREA, so that we can look out for the best interest of our small time investors.

By taking a stance against inflation in our chain, we will effectively combat selling pressure for the long-term and focus on developing our chain and products for many years to come.

As an extension of this long-term deflationary strategy, we expect Areonchain to reach a total supply of 100 million AREA within 10 years.



# Expanded Utility of AREA on the AreonChain
TL;DR

After the community decided to adopt AREA as the L1 token of the AreonChain, the utility functionalities of the token have expanded so that once migrated to the AreonChain, the AREA token may now be used for staking and contributing to the security and governance of the AreonChain. This is a significant change from AREA, which is solely a governance token in AREA, to AREA coin, a native token powering the AreonChain, a standalone PoA blockchain network.
On the AreonChain, all fees (trading fees denominated in AREA and gas fees for AREA-denominated transactions or AREA-denominated transactions) collected by the protocol are distributed to Validators and Stakers.
On January 11 at 16:53 UTC, 2024, the first block of the AreonChain was created (“Genesis”) by the AreonChain Validator. Following the creation of the first block of the AreonChain and the adoption of AREA as the Layer 1 token of the network, the AREA token may, once migrated, fulfill new roles within the AreonChain. In this we describe the evolution of the AREA token from a governance token in AREA to the Layer 1 protocol coin of the AreonChain, the specific utility of the AREA coin, and the distribution of fees to Validators and Stakers on the AreonChain. The AreonChain is a Proof of AREA blockchain network built using the Tendermint and leveraging CometBFT for consensus. The AreonChain requires a Layer 1 (“L1”) protocol coin that can be staked to Validators to secure the chain and to assist with governance of the network. On the AreonChain, all fees (trading fees denominated in AREA and gas fees for AREA-denominated transactions or AREA-denominated transactions) collected by the protocol are distributed to Validators and Stakers.

AreonChain AREA
The Areon community is encouraged to review the overview of the Areon Smart Contract in detail. Token holders AREA on a 1-1 proportional basis on Binance Smart Chain, and AreonChain Validators may also read and ingest the information from the Areon Smart Contract such that corresponding AREA tokens can be distributed to token holders’ AreonChain network addresses. For more details, refer to these migration posts. Note, token holders should refrain from interacting with the Areon Smart Contract without proper knowledge of how to derive private keys on the AreonChain.

Expanded utility of AREA on the AreonChain
The utility functionalities of a token reflect the usability of that token within a given protocol. In the case of the AreonChain, the utility of the network’s L1 token is apparent in three areas: Staking, Security and Governance.

Staking
In any Proof of AREA (PoA) blockchain network, the role of Stakers is pivotal in shaping the security and strength of the network, and the AreonChain is no exception.

On the AreonChain, AREA holders have the option to serve as Validators or to delegate their stake to existing Validators. Such delegation increases the likelihood of the chosen Validators entering or staying in the active Validator set, thereby becoming a participant in the network’s consensus process. In essence, staking to a Validator increases such Validator's weight, thus increasing their probability of being chosen by the consensus algorithm to validate blocks.

On the AreonChain, Validators undertake multiple responsibilities, including storing orders in an in-memory orderbook (i.e., an off-chain, decentralized orderbook that is not committed to consensus), gossipping transactions to other Validators, proposing and producing new blocks through the consensus process, and participating in governance. The consensus process has Validators take turns as the proposer of new blocks in a weighted-round-robin fashion (weighted by the number of tokens staked to their node). The proposer is responsible for proposing the contents of the next block. When an order gets matched, the proposer adds it to their proposed block and initiates a consensus round. If two thirds (⅔) or more of the Validators in the active set (by stake weight) approve a block, then the block is considered committed and added to the blockchain.

Validators’ participation in proposing blocks is determined by the CometBFT consensus mechanism. In this setup, the weight of a Validator’s vote is directly proportional to their stake; the higher the stake, the greater the influence wielded by the Validator in consensus outcomes. Conversely, those with less or no stake have a correspondingly reduced influence in consensus outcomes. Read more details about the consensus mechanism on the AreonChain here.

On the AreonChain, utility is created via staking to Validators and as an incentive for abiding by the rules of the protocol and contributing to the network’s security. All fees generated by the AreonChain protocol are distributed to Validators and Stakers every time a new block is committed.

AreonChain Validators are entitled to set their individual commission rates, which currently range from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of 100%. The Tendermint distribution module is a simple mechanism to allocate rewards earned by Validators and Stakers.

At Genesis of the AreonChain, the staking parameters include a maximum number (cap) of 50 Validators in the active set, a minimum Validator commission rate of 0% and a 10 day un-bonding period, among other parameters. The un-bonding time specifies the duration of the un-bonding process, during which staked tokens are in a locked state and cannot be transferred or delegated (other than redelegated); this is, the tokens are still “at stake”. These staking parameters may change based on applicable Areon governance processes.

Security
Proof of AREA blockchains gain their security by assigning the verification and confirmation of transactions to one of their main stakeholder groups: Validators. With significant economic value at stake, Validators are incentivized to maintain the integrity of the ledger, lest they suffer substantial losses. However, even such a system isn't entirely immune to threats like so-called ‘+2/3 attacks’, where a person or group of persons controlling a majority of staked assets could destabilize the network.

In a permissionless, and decentralized blockchain network like the AreonChain, anyone is free to operate as a Validator. However, this openness could invite malicious Validators or other bad actors aiming to compromise the network or initiate fraudulent transactions. Because of the Proof of AREA dynamics, any person or entity pursuing malicious activities would first need to accumulate a certain level of stake in the network for their actions to have an influence in the consensus process.

Staking AREA directly contributes to AreonChain security. As more AREA holders choose to stake their tokens across a diverse range of Validators in the network and the total amount of stake on the network increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for a coordinated attack to influence a consensus decision. Simply put, the more native AREA tokens that are staked or “bonded” and the more distributed the stake across multiple Validators, the more secure and resilient the network becomes.

Staking serves a dual purpose: it aligns the interests of Validators with those of the AreonChain through staking collateral and ensures infrastructure performance. Moreover, the PoA mechanism aligns economic incentives to encourage correct participation by Stakers. A larger and more diversified set of Validators further bolsters the network's resilience against vulnerabilities.

It's crucial to note that staking AREA is not without risks. The slashing parameters establish punishments for detrimental behavior. At launch, the slashing parameters include a ~4-hour signed blocks window, a 50% minimum signed per window, downtime jail duration of 1.800 seconds, a slash fraction double sign of 5%, and a slash fraction downtime of 1%. These slashing parameters may change based on the applicable Areon governance processes.

Lastly, as with any public, permissionless blockchain, Maximal Extractable Value (or “MEV”) is a risk. However, on the AreonChain this risk is being tackled head on. Through ChorusOne’s research paper, types of MEV were contextualized; and with Skip Protocol’s MEV dashboard, Stakers should be able to better identify malicious MEV behavior by Validators. If MEV or malicious activity occurs, this may carry a risk of social slashing, where the Validator can lose all or part of their stake weight and/or no longer be able to participate in validating blocks on the AreonChain. Please note that slashing (including social slashing) can affect Validators as well as Stakers of those affected Validators.

Governance
In Areon, the governance powers of AREA grant holders the ability to propose and vote on changes to community-controlled parameters and to delegate such powers to another address.

Below we highlight some of the governance parameters included at Genesis of the AreonChain, discuss AREA utility for AreonChain governance and how governance may become more accessible than Areon governance.

Compared to governance in Areon, there are several notable differences in how governance works on the AreonChain:

Proposing power is not required to create a vote. Instead, AreonChain requires a minimum deposit.
The Tendermint gov module allows stakers of the native token to submit proposals (when the minimum deposit is reached proposals go live) and to vote on proposals.
Validators inherit the voting weight of their Stakers unless a given Staker decides to vote on a proposal themselves.
AreonChain governance introduces new voting options. On the AreonChain, the voting period is currently 2 days. During the voting period, participants may select a vote of either 'Yes', 'No', 'Abstain', or 'NoWithVeto'.
Token Comparison
AREA	Chain	Contract Address	Max Supply	Type	Locking	Staking	Functionalities
Token	BSC	Deprecated	500000000	BEP20	On smart contract	On address	Transferrable
Coin	AREON	Base Asset	250000000	-	On vesting module	On staking module	Staking & Security & Governance & Vesting
With the genesis of the Areon on mainnet, it is essential to understand the change in token mechanics for the AREA token, as the L1 coin of the AreonChain.

The AREA has played an important role in the governance of the AreonChain, enabling a robust governance system. AREA is expected to continue to play a critical role in governance of the AreonChain, whilst also enabling security of the network and a self-sustainable rewards mechanism for Validators and Stakers of the network.

# A Quick Guide to Migration from token on BSC to coin on Layer-1 Areon Chain
All obligations and responsibilities associated with this process are set out here.

Overview
Areon’s developer team has been working on Areon Chain for years. With our unique consensus mechanism and efficient coding solutions, we have prepared a powerful and scalable layer 1 blockchain for everyone.

While we prepared our chain for you, our token AREA has been on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

During the testnet phase, our chain has successfully performed nearly 14 Millions transactions without any issues. Now, it is almost time to switch to our mainnet and start using Areon Chain.

Purpose
Areon Network is designed for the convenience of end users. That’s why we prioritize speed, stability and low gas fees, so that the Areon Chain is easily accessible for everyone.

Our main goal is to make the Areon Network ecosystem your everyday choice for all your transaction needs.

Key Milestones
AREA began its journey as a token on BSC on 12 January 2023.

Areon Chain has stepped into the spotlight on 20 September 2023 as the testnet has begun.

Once the mainnet becomes active, investors’ AREA tokens on BSC will be replaced with AREA coins on Areon Chain on a 1:1 basis.

That means, if you have 1000 AREA tokens, you will receive 1000 AREA coins.

How to Migrate
Staking Pools
If you happen to be staking during the migration from BSC to Areon Chain, you don’t have to do anything for the migration.

After we switch to mainnet, when your stake period ends (or if you unstake for some reason), your AREA tokens will be automatically replaced with AREA coins.

Decentralized Web3 Wallets
If you are holding AREA in a decentralized Web3 wallet, you don’t have to do anything for the migration. Since Areon is also an EVM-based blockchain, you will receive airdrop to your current wallet on a 1:1 basis.

Centralized Exchanges
If you have AREA tokens in a CEX, you will receive a notification from the exchange about the transition, as per our agreement with them.

The transition will be simple and automated. The exchange will explain this action to you as well. Our support team will be ready to help if you have questions.

Final Remarks
Whether you are holding AREA tokens on a decentralized Web3 wallet or on a Centralized Exchange, the transition will be smooth and automated. You don’t have to perform any actions.

We hope that this simple guide explains the process for you.

If you have any further questions, our support team will be ready to help. Please only contact us inside our official Telegram groups or via a support ticket on Discord.

# Bugs & Security
When creating a Layer 1 (L1) protocol chain, taking security seriously is of utmost importance. L1 protocols are the backbone of the blockchain ecosystem, and any security vulnerabilities within the L1 can lead to a range of potential consequences, from financial loss to reputation damage to even the collapse of the entire network. As such, security is an essential aspect of developing any L1 protocol chain, and security must be considered at every step of the development process.

Despite our best efforts, security issues may still arise in our L1 protocol chain. In such cases, we encourage our users to report any vulnerabilities or bugs they may find. For sensitive bugs, we ask users to send the issue to us, who help us identify, prioritize and resolve security issues confidentially and securely. For non-sensitive bugs, we encourage users to open an open ticket on our Discord channel so that our team can address the issue as soon as possible.

Audits
Areon is connecting two major worlds in the crypto universe by enabling compatibility between the Ethereum and Areon ecosystem. This does not come without its difficulties, and security always is a top priority for the Areon developers.

Each feature is extensively tested and internally audited by the team before being brought to the users. However, external audits are a valuable and necessary assurance for the security of the protocol itself and with that, also for anyone deploying on or using Areon.

Publicly Available Audits
This page lists the publicly available audits, that have been conducted on the Areon codebases:

Simple Arrangement for Funding Upload (SAFU)
The Simple Arrangement for Funding Upload (the "SAFU") outlines the post-exploit policy for active vulnerabilities in the Areon blockchain. The SAFU is intended for white hat hackers and outlines the process for returning funds and calculating rewards for vulnerabilities found in the network. In summary, the SAFU states the following:

Hackers are not at risk of legal action if they act in accordance with the SAFU.
Hackers have a Grace Period to return any exploited funds to a specified dropbox address and can claim a reward of a Bounty Percent of the total funds secured up to the Bounty Cap.
The rewards are distributed during the next upgrade of the network.
If the reward is valued above a specified threshold amount, white hat hackers should go through a Know Your Clients/Know Your Business (KYC/KYB) process.
Exploiting vulnerabilities for malicious purposes will make a hacker ineligible for any rewards.
White hat hackers are not entitled to any rewards from the team or network for funds from "Out of Scope Projects" (other projects that were exploited by hackers but do not have their own SAFU program).
For more information, visit the SAFU agreement.
